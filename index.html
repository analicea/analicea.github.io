  <p>The Siberian Husky is a beautiful dog breed with a thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia. It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s wolf-like looks, but be aware that this athletic, intelligent dog can be independent and challenging for first-time dog owners.For those looking for a calm dog to settle with on the couch in the evenings and maybe enjoy a short stroll around the block a few times a week, the Siberian Husky isn’t a match. The same goes for those looking for a devoted companion who lives to please and hangs on his owner’s every word.Many have fallen in love with the wild nature and pride of Huskies, but are unaware just what this breed is truly like. This is not a breed for everyone. Their beauty often drives people to purchase them, unaware of their difficult traits, which makes many Siberian Huskies prime candidates for shelters.  </p>
